**1) What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic was data quality in GUI agent training, particularly how diverse, high-quality GUI interaction data can drastically improve reinforcement learning outcomes. Understanding how small agents achieve robust performance through structured action spaces and well-designed rewards was especially insightful.

**2) Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
For Quarter 2, I’d like to explore adaptive data filtering for GUI agent training, where an automated policy learns to identify and discard low-quality data. This investigation would test whether dynamically curated datasets lead to more stable and generalizable GUI agents compared to static datasets.

**3) What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
In the current project, I’d add a human-in-the-loop data evaluation step to complement automated scoring. Human feedback could provide valuable signals for ambiguous GUI states that automated metrics might misjudge, improving overall dataset reliability.

**4) What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I’d be interested in using visual-linguistic embedding models like CLIP for semantic matching between actions and outcomes, and self-play reinforcement learning to allow the agent to iteratively refine its policies using its own generated data.
